This is a brief introduction to R, the statistical programming language.
 
Simply install R per your operating system's instructions, launch R, and then copy and paste each line that doesn't begin with a # in order to see the results in your own version of R.

Critical language features are demonstrated with explanations provided in the comment lines (marked by #).
